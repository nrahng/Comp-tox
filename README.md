The main goal of the project
The final manuscript name, year it was published, Pub Med ID (if applicable)
Graphical abstract (if needed for publication)
Names and brief descriptions of each file
Include both the goal of the analysis and the methodology used (ie. Using chi square tests to determine if there are statistically significant differences across demographic groups)
If the code was written in the software Jupyter (ie. has the extension .ipynb not .R or .Rmd), NBViewer is a website that can render jupyter notebooks (files). This is helpful, because sometimes the files take too long to render, so link the repository from the NB viewer website.
Go to nbviewer.org –> type in the name of the repository –> copy the url and add it to the README.md file
